Matlab code for running the analyses (Analyze_....) and for creating the figures (MakeFigure...).
The Analyze functions load the original data files, implement analyses and save results. 
Those result files were too big to be uploaded on git, as they contain results from data randomizations
  
The MakeFigure functions require these intermediate files to produce figures.
