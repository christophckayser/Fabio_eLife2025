-----------------------------------------------------------
Data: Contains the data from each participant. 

Matlab : The matlab code for running the analyses and creating the figures based on that. 
Matlab/func: additional subroutines

The analysis routines implement randomization approaches and save intermediate results, which were too big to upload here.
These intermediate results are required to generate the figures. 

Simulations: The matlab code for running the simulations.
