Data files for each experiment 1-4. 
These are used by the Analyze_... functions to implement the analyses. 

The format of the data is as follows:

ARG holds metadata, incl. parameters for data cleaning
ARG.Ntrial: [Number of trials recorded, retained, SubId]
ARG.Thr: final stimulus parameters (per ear and frequency) for each particiapnt
ARG.Thr: initial stimulus parameters (per ear and frequency) for each particiapnt
ARG.VarList: Names of variables in main data structure

Dat_all{SubId} has for each trial (trial,:) the following 12 values (see ARG.VarList)
% 
{'TrialNr'}: Trial Number in each block
{'Freq'}: Frequency of target tone. Binary. The two experimental conditions to be discriminiated.
{'Ear'}: Ear of target tone. For experiments 1-3 the order is 1-3: {'Both','Left','Right'}; For exp3: Left, right, both
{'SOA'}: The continous SOA betwween background onset and target time. Maine variable of interest
{'SOABin'}: The same, but binned.
{'RT_Onset'}: The RT for each trial relative to background onset in ms
{'Button'}: Response button. Assigment to each stimulus was randomized across participants
{'Resp'}: Response correct (1) or wrong (0)
{'SNR'}: SNR of the target relative to background. Was adaptive during the experiment.
{'TotalTrialNr'}: Trial Id across blocks = trial number within block + (block-1)*1000
{'SubId'}: participant ID
{'RT_Target'}: reaction time to target onset in ms
